# Neural Architecture Search (NAS)

This project implements an automated machine learning framework for discovering optimal neural network architectures using reinforcement learning algorithms. It features distributed search space exploration, GPU acceleration, and efficient candidate evaluation.

## Features
- Policy-based reinforcement learning for architecture design
- Distributed search space exploration with Ray
- GPU acceleration with CUDA optimizations
- Efficient candidate evaluation through shared weights
- Progressive architecture growth to manage complexity
- Automated hyperparameter tuning

## Configuration

### Search Configuration (`configs/search.yaml`)
```yaml
search:
  num_episodes: 1000
  num_workers: 8
  use_gpu: true

policy:
  learning_rate: 1e-4
  gamma: 0.99
  clip_param: 0.2

env:
  dataset: "cifar10"
  max_epochs: 50
```

### Training Configuration (`configs/train.yaml`)
```yaml
model:
  architecture: "models/architectures/best_candidate.pth"
  learning_rate: 1e-3
  batch_size: 64

training:
